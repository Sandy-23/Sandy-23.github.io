	<p>Starcraft II is an online videogame played all over the world and it’s especially played a lot in South Korea. It’s an eSport with professional players and it’s broadcasted over the internet as well as some TV channels in Korea. It’s developed by Blizzard Entertainment.</p>
	<p>Blizzard Entertainment is known for having the best quality games. They are located in Irvine, California. Their main games include Starcraft, Warcraft, and Diablo. They have made a few older games, including “Lost Vikings”, “Rock N Roll Racing”, and others. Warcraft: Orcs vs Humans was released in 1994. Warcraft II was released in 1995 and became a hit. They released the first Starcraft game in 1998 and a few months later, in the same year, they released the expansion, “Brood War”. The game became very popular in Korea and became one of the most competitive video games ever played. Even now that Starcraft II has been released, many still prefer Starcraft Brood War, although, it just recently lost its status as an eSport. Starcraft II is very similar to the original, but has smoother pathing, updated graphics, and just smoother gameplay in general. There were 3 installments of this game, “Wings of Liberty” released in 2010, “Heart of the Swarm” released in 2013, and “Legacy of the Void” released in 2015, each providing a new single player campaign and improvements and additions to the game. The latest game is a popular eSport, played by millions of people around the world.</p>

	<p>Starcraft II brings in an impressive revenue. According to <a href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/blizzard-entertainment-statistics/">http://www.statisticbrain.com/blizzard-entertainment-statistics/</a>, Blizzards total revenue was $6,975,000,000. World of Warcraft is their biggest source of income at $2,900,000,000, but Starcraft II still made $542,500,000 with 8,600,000 copies of the game sold.</p>
	<p>Starcraft II is a real-time strategy game, involving quick thinking, quick key strokes, and fast and accurate mouse actions. You basically build a base, train a military, and destroy the enemy base. I’ll give you a complete run-down of what the game is like.</p>
	<p>When you start a match, you first select your race. You can choose between Protoss, Zerg, or Terran. Each race has balanced, but different units and buildings available to them. I’ll take you through the game using the Terran units and buildings, but remember that if you are playing as a different race, you will have different units, though some are pretty similar between all races.</p>
	<p>You start out with a command center and a handful of SCV’s (the worker units who collect minerals and gas). You start out by a mineral field and gas geysers and the SCV’s collect those resources for you. With enough resources, you can buy more SCV’s, which will increase your resource collection rate. One major aspect of the game is the economy management. You want lots of SCV’s but you don’t want to waste all of your resources on SCV’s for reasons I’ll explain later. Just remember, you will have to balance everything you purchase and when you purchase them.</p>
	<p>The SCV’s can also be used to build buildings. Supply depots are required to be built throughout the game. They raise the amount of units that you can build (supply limit). Each one raises the supply a little, so the more unites you get, the more supply depots you have to build. The units can be SCV’s or military units. In order to build the military units, you first have to build the building associated with that unit. Here’s a list of the buildings and the units associated with them to give you an idea of the different units you could train.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Barracks
			<ul>
				<li>Marine</li>
				<li>Marauder</li>
				<li>Reaper</li>
				<li>Ghost</li>
			</ul>
		</li>Factory
		<li>
			<ul>
				<li>Hellion</li>
				<li>Siege Tank</li>
				<li>Thor</li>
				<li>Helbat</li>
				<li>Cyclone</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Starport
			<ul>
				<li>Viking</li>
				<li>Medivac</li>
				<li>Raven</li>
				<li>Banshee</li>
				<li>Battlecruiser</li>
				<li>Liberator</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The Barracks is one of the first buildings that you would create. Marines are small, light, ranged units that can be deadly in big packs, but are also susceptible to things that do splash damage, such as siege tanks. Marauders are slower firing ground units that are good against larger units. Reapers are fast and can go up and down cliffs to gain advantages. Ghosts can only be used after other buildings have been built to allow the production of them. They can be used to call down nuclear strikes and can cloak.</p>
	<p>After you build the barracks, you are allowed to build the Starport and the Factory. What you choose to build, and when, will depend on what your particular strategy is. One strategy is to build early military units as fast as you can and then attack the enemy before they can get enough defenses. Usually you can’t win that way, but you can apply pressure and possibly force them to build certain units that you can counter, or keep them from building at locations that would be beneficial to them.</p>
	<p>I said before that one of the aspects of the game is the economy. A good way to boost your economy is to “expand”. Expanding is where you build another command center in a new location where there are minerals and gas geysers. It’s time consuming and expensive to get the command center built, but if you can keep it defended, the rewards are great. Any advantage you can get economically, will improve your chances of winning.</p>
	<p>Since economy is so important in the game, one tactic is to harass the enemy SCV’s. They can be easily killed if you can get to them but you don’t want to sacrifice your own army to kill their SCV’s because he could then easily counter attack and you wouldn’t have enough units to defend.</p>
	<p>There are many different types of units and each is better at certain things than the rest. You have to pick units that are the best to counter what the enemy has. Some can fly. Some have a large attack range. Some are melee fighters. Some have splash damage. Some can cloak. Some can burrow underground. Some can go up and down cliffs. Some have other special abilities. They can each be upgraded by researching upgrades at different buildings.</p>
	<p>You win when you destroy all of the enemy base. Usually this is done by weakening the enemy’s army enough to gain enough of an advantage that you can get to their buildings without too much resistance. The one with the bigger and better army usually wins but it also depends on how you use your army. If your army marches in a narrow line into the enemy who is lined up tangent to your line, the ones in front will be easily picked off by the line of enemy units who can easily get within range to attack them while the rest of your army is still marching up. By the time your last unit gets to the battle, the first units will be mostly dead. So you can see that a lot of the game can be about positioning of your army.</p>
	<p>It’s a very difficult game to master. The pros live with their teams in team houses in Korea. They play/practice usually for about the whole day. They basically eat, breath, and sleep Starcraft II. There is a measurement that is commonly used to determine how fast a player plays. It’s called “APM” (Actions per Minute). Each action (key stroke our mouse click) is recorded during a game and averaged out per minute. Pro Starcraft II players usually have average APM of more than 300. They discuss strategies, and practice the basics. They practice to be fast.</p>
	<p>If you are good enough, you can play in the tournaments and get a chance at winning a lot of prize money. Otherwise, you can still play online with Blizzard’s gaming site, Battle.net. After playing a few games, they automatically categorize you in a metallic level of players your skill level (bronze, silver, gold, platinum, diamond, master, grand master). When you improve, you go up a level. This means that it’s great for players of any skill level. The better you are, the more competitive the game will become. On 4/30/2016, at 8:09 A.M., there were 14,446 Starcraft II games being played worldwide and 9689 players in chatrooms. Blizzard is dedicated to making sure that players have a good online experience. Players don’t normally experience any lag or disconnects.</p>
	<p>The latest WCS tournament by Blizzard Entertainment has a prize pool of over $2 Million. Taking 1st place yields $200,000. The payout is somewhat small for all the time and effort it takes to be that good, but at least the pros are doing what they love. After all, it’s still a video game, even though many people are aspiring to making a career out of it. Most pros are in Korea so if you are a pro and you live outside of Korea, you probably have to move to Korea. It can be hard trying to make ends meet as a pro Starcraft II player. It can also be hard to be a Starcraft II commentator.</p>
	<p>Nick “Tasteless” Plott and Dan “Artosis” Stemkoski, released a documentary called “Sons of Starcraft”, which describes the ups and downs of playing Starcraft to become pro and then becoming commentators and moving to Korea. They had rough beginnings but are now celebrities among the Starcraft community.</p>
	<p>Nick’s younger brother, Sean Plott, was one of the rare Starcraft Broodwar pros. He had the fastest non-Korean APM of about 350. He did well but he’s not Korean so… he didn’t become the greatest player. Instead he became the host of a live video broadcast all about Starcraft II (originally), as well as a commentator at Starcraft tournaments. Then he got a “real” job and didn’t have enough time for all of the in-depth analysis of Starcraft. Instead, he turned to “Hearthstone”, a less competitive online card game by Blizzard. Others have also been Starcraft II personalities on the internet.</p>
	<p>Here’s the current top 10 list of pro Starcraft II players and the total amount of money they have won from tournaments:</p>
