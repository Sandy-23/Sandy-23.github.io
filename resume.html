	I feel that I would be a great fit for the position of Parks 
	and Rec Director because I am a very upbeat and positive person. 
	I always have a smile on my face and I go above and beyond 
	in everything that I do. I really care about the environment
	and the happiness of the people in the environment. I believe 
	that I can make a difference by implementing new programs to 
	keep the parks clean and functional, holding more concerts
	in the park, and opening a petting zoo that features my favorite
	little pony and other animals. I know that I am the right person 
	for the job and I won't let you down!</p>
