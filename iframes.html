	<p>Ted Cruz is being criticized by the Muslim community and civil rights advocates for his comments relating to the 
	bombings in Brussels. He pushes for more surveillance in neighborhoods that are mostly Muslims in order to prevent 
	them from becoming radical terrorists. While Donald Trump supports it 100%, others disagree. See what they have to 
	say in this article from the Deseret News.</p>

	<p>Ted Cruz says that New Yorkers are looking for more safety. He says that implementing surveillance programs in 
	Muslim communities will increase saftey. He is getting a lot of criticism from Muslims and civil rights advocates. 
	They say that it sends a message that American Muslims are not really part of America and that it is a wrong thing 
	to do. Donald Trump agrees 100% with Ted Cruz on this issue.</p>
	<p>The Anti-Defamation League says it's similar to the relocation of japanese Americans in World War II. Linda 
	Sarsour, executive director of the Arab American Association of New York, says that it might fuel vigilantes who 
	want to take matters into their own hands when it comes to surveillance and that could be very dangerous. Muslims 
	consider themselves to be a peaceful people besides a few radical groups who actually disagree with Islam. They say 
	that the Islamic State doesn't really follow Islamic rules.</p>
