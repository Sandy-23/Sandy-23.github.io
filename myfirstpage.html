Whether we're composing a blog or a business letter, 
an email or an essay, our goal should be to respond 
clearly and directly to the needs and interests of 
our readers. These 10 tips should help us sharpen 
our writing whenever we set out to inform or persuade.

<h3>Lead with your main idea.</h3>
<p>As a <b>general</b> rule, <strong>state</strong> the main idea of a paragraph 
in the first sentence--the topic sentence. Don't keep 
your readers guessing.<p/>

<h3>Vary the length of your sentences.</h3>
<p>In <i>general</i>, use short <em>sentences</em> to emphasize ideas. 
Use longer sentences to explain, define, or illustrate 
ideas.</p>

<h3>Put key words and ideas at the beginning or end of a 
sentence.</h3>
<p>Don't bury a <b><i>main point</i></b> in the middle of a long sentence. 
To emphasize key words, place them at the beginning 
or (better yet) at the end.</p>

<h3>Vary sentence types and structures.</h3>
<p>Vary <u>sentence types</U> by including occasional questions 
and commands. Vary sentence structures by blending simple, 
compound, and complex sentences.</p>

<h3>Use active verbs.</h3>
<p>Don't <font size="5" color="#ff0000" face ="sans-serif">overwork</font> the passive voice or forms of the verb 
"to be." Instead, use dynamic verbs in the active voice.</p>

<h3>Use specific nouns and verbs.</h3>
<p><q>To convey your message clearly and keep your readers 
engaged, use concrete and specific words that show what 
you mean.</q></p>

<h3>Cut the clutter.</h3>
<p><q>When revising your work, eliminate unnecessary words.</q></p>

<h3>Read aloud when you revise.</h3>
<p><blockquote>When revising, you may hear problems (of tone, emphasis, 
word choice, and syntax) that you can't see. So listen up!</blockquote></p>

<h3>Actively edit and proofread.</h3>
<p>It's easy to overlook errors when merely looking over your 
work. <br/><br/>So be on the lookout for common trouble spots when 
studying your final draft.</p>

<h3>Use a dictionary.</h3>
<p>When proofreading, don't trust your spellchecker: it can 
tell you only if a word is a word, not if it's the right word.</p>
